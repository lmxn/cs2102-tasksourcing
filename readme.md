# CS2102 Task Sourcing

The system is a catalog of tasks submitted by users. Users can either submit a task or pick a task. Tasks are general chores such washing a car on Kent Valeâ€™s carpark on Sunday, or delivering a parcel on Tuesday between 17:00 and 19:00, etc. Each user has an account managed by the system. Administrators can create, modify and delete all entries.
